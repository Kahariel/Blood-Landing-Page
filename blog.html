            Organ donation and transplantation allows a deceased or living donor
            to give life to another. Surgeons remove a healthy organ from a
            donor who doesn't need it and transfer it to someone else who does.

          <h1>Why Blood Donation is Important</h1>
          <p>
            Every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood. Blood is
            essential to help patients survive surgeries, cancer treatment,
            chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries. This lifesaving care
            starts with one person making a generous donation. The need for
            blood is constant. But only about 3% of age-eligible people donate
            blood yearly. You can help the American Red Cross make sure that

          <h1>Benefits of Donating Blood</h1>
          <p>
            What's the connection? “If your hemoglobin is too high, blood
            donation helps to lower the viscosity of the blood, which has been
            associated with the formation of blood clots, heart attacks, and
            stroke,” Dr. DeSimone says. “Interestingly, these benefits are more
            significant in men compared to women. We think maybe it's because
            women have menstrual cycles, so they do it naturally without
            donating blood.”
